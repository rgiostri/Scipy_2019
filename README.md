# Additional Files for SciPy 2019 Submission.

Notes:

1 - The jupyter notebook file was written to be used in a Google Colab for simplicity.

2 - The sample images has 9 images with simple compression for facilitate download of github. 
To use in Jupyter example, first decompress the images. We suggest use comand line:

$ mogrify -format bmp *.jpeg
